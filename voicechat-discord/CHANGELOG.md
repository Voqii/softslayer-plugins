# Simple Voice Chat Discord Bridge Changelog

## 3.2.1

- Fix NeoForge builds on Modrinth not including most of the mod's code

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.2.0...3.2.1

GitHub Actions workflow changes: None

## 3.2.0

- Add support for Minecraft versions 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, and 26.2
- Add NeoForge support for Minecraft versions 1.20.5-26.2 (this has been implemented for a while, but I never got around to releasing it)
- Drop support for the following Minecraft versions on Paper: 1.16.5, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20, 1.20.1, 1.20.2, 1.20.3, 1.20.4
  - If you need to use any of these versions on Paper, please make an issue on GitHub
- Internal changes:
  - Switch to Mojang mappings on Fabric
  - Build without obfuscation on Paper (this is why we had to drop support for Minecraft versions below 1.20.5)
  - Use voicechat_api mod ID instead of voicechat mod ID for checking required voicechat API version on Fabric and NeoForge

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.1.4...3.2.0

GitHub Actions workflow changes: https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/compare/3.1.2...3.2.0

## 3.1.4

- Updated songbird to the next branch. This should fix any issues with DAVE.
- Switched to `opus2` Rust crate. As we already updated to Opus 1.5.2, this shouldn't change anything.

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.1.3...3.1.4

GitHub Actions workflow changes: None

## 3.1.3

- Updated songbird to PR [#291](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/pull/291) to add support for DAVE in Discord voice calls.

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.1.2+build-fix...3.1.3

GitHub Actions workflow changes: None

## 3.1.2

- Fixed the infamous issue of needing a newer glibc than is available on old LTS Linux distributions ([#144](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/144), [#63](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/63), [#106](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/106))
  - The minimum glibc version is now 2.26; if anyone needs lower than this, just make a GitHub issue. However, note that glibc 2.26 was released in *2017*...
- Renamed the Rust log file (previously `logs/voicechat-discord.log`) to `logs/voicechat-discord.txt`.
- Updated various URLs to use the GitLab repo instead of the GitHub repo.
- Fixed a copy of slf4j being included in the jar.
- Moved SVC version checking code to Paper because it is unnecessary on Fabric.
- Fixed checking if a player is an operator if the server has a non-default op permission level configured on Fabric.
- Refactored Fabric codebase to use source templates when version specific code is needed instead of a messy version specific class.
- Fabric versions that produce an identical jar will now be combined to reduce the number of jars that are built.
- Fixed Fabric API dependency on 1.16.5 by using the legacy mod ID.
- Fixed Folia not being marked as supported.
- Added support for 1.21.11.

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.1.1...3.1.2+build-fix

GitHub Actions workflow changes: https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/compare/3.1.1...3.1.2

## 3.1.1

- Minecraft versions 1.16.5, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.x, and 1.21.x are now supported.
- On Paper, reflection is no longer used to get entity positions when calculating distance. This was mainly done to make it easier to support the aforementioned wide range of Minecraft versions with a single jar.
- Folia is now supported.
- Some dependencies were removed in order to reduce jar size.
  - The SemVer dependency we were using was replaced by a simple version parser.
  - The gson dependency we were using was removed because it was not being used.
- Fixed a bug with opus decoder resets that caused them to never occur.
- Edge cases when logging in to a Discord bot that used to cause crashes are now handled cleanly. ([#126](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/126))
- The `whisper_distance` SVC config option is now properly supported. ([#140](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/140))
- Rust logs are now added to `logs/voicechat-discord.log`.
- Some error messages were improved.
- A few other internal improvements.

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.0.13...3.1.1

## 3.0.13

- Rust dependencies were updated. This should fix issues related to connecting to Discord's servers. ([#136](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/136))

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.0.12...3.0.13

## 3.0.12

- Minecraft versions 1.21.9 and 1.21.10 are now supported.
- There is now a separate Fabric jar for each Minecraft version.
- Adventure usage has been removed. This allows us to remove the messy code used to convert Adventure messages to Minecraft messages on Fabric, and generally just reduces code complexity and increases performance.
- The update checker has been completely removed.
- Opus has been updated to 1.5.2.
- The bot setup guide has been updated. Previously broken images have been fixed.
- Miscellaneous internal improvements.

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.0.11...3.0.12

## 3.0.11

- The supported Minecraft versions have been drastically narrowed down.
  - We now support:
    - 1.19.2
    - 1.20.1
    - 1.21.1
    - 1.21.4
    - 1.21.5 (newly supported)
    - 1.21.8 (newly supported)
  - All other Minecraft versions are not considered supported. This list is based on [Simple Voice Chat's supported versions](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/supported_versions). Future releases will follow any changes made to that list of supported versions.
  - Thanks to the smaller range of supported Minecraft versions, manually testing all supported versions is now feasible, and all versions have been tested on both Fabric and Paper.
- The update checker has been simplified and improved so that it will be resilient if major changes such as releasing a separate jar for every supported Minecraft version (as opposed to the current method of releasing a single jar for all supported versions) are made in the future.
- Log messages on Fabric are now prefixed with `[voicechat-discord]`.
- Attempting to shut down natives that have not been loaded will no longer cause the plugin to fail to shut down.
- The Fabric Permissions API has been upgraded to version 0.3.3 in order to fix compatibility issues with recent Minecraft versions.
- Due to recent GitHub deprecations, Linux natives will now be built on Ubuntu 22.04. This means that there may be errors on hosting providers using old glibc versions. If you encounter this issue, please see [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72513993/how-to-install-glibc-2-29-or-higher-in-ubuntu-18-04).

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/3.0.0...3.0.1

## 3.0.0

- Major internal changes, which should result in better stability and performance
    - The JDA Java discord library is no longer used and it has been replaced by the Serenity and Songbird Rust discord
      libraries
    - This means that the plugin requires some native libraries, which unfortunately increased the JAR size
    - The advantage is that SSL is bundled with the libraries instead of requiring Java's SSL,
      fixing [#11](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/11)
    - The new implementation should be faster and less prone to getting into a buggy state
- Many fixes to fix support for 1.20.3 and later
    - On the Fabric side, usage of JSON to convert between adventure and native component classes was removed. Now,
      components are manually converted which should be much more robust and slightly more performant
    - On the Paper side, in 1.20.6 and later, the new Commands API is used, and in <1.20.6, reflection is used in more
      places due to Paperweight's new mapping behavior breaking stuff
- Require Java 21 (the addon still supports 1.19.4)

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/2.1.1...3.0.0

## 2.1.1

- (Fabric) Fixed [#25](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/25) - **/dvc now works correctly on
  1.20+!** Sorry this took so long to fix; I actually fixed it almost a month ago but never made a release.
- Fixed a minor punctuation issue with the message about Simple Voice Chat not being new enough
- Increased minimum Minecraft version to 1.19.4 from 1.19.2

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/2.1.0...2.1.1

## 2.1.0

This update has some new features and bugfixes. The minimum Simple Voice Chat version has been increased to 2.4.11.

- Reduce volume of whispering players in the audio that goes to discord
- Don't allow players to use `/dvc group` when groups are disabled
- Fixed tab complete on Paper
- Switch to using adventure and minimessage for messages. This means that we no longer use the legacy formatting codes,
  and some messages will have colors in the console!

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/2.0.1...2.1.0

## 2.0.1

This update fixes one of the major issues with 2.0.0. If you are on Fabric, you probably didn't experience it, but you
should still update because of the other fixes and improvements.

- Fixed [#22](https://github.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/issues/22)
- Switch to a simpler volume adjustment method. While this seems to work fine, please report any issues with the audio
  going to Discord!
- Slight improvement: packets with a volume less than or equal to 0 (which ends up being silent) won't be sent to
  Discord. This can happen when we receive packets out of the distance of the player
- Improve reset watcher to be slower, this may fix some audio related issues
- Make NMS usage and reflection on Paper safer and hopefully future proof it more

Code changes: https://gitlab.com/amsam0/voicechat-discord/-/compare/2.0.0...2.0.1
